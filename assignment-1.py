print('''Grading:
This course is A-E graded and the grades are determined based on graded assignments:
Weekly assignments count for ~80% of the final grade. A new graded assignment will be issued
every week on Brightspace. Refer to grading criteria below.
Midterm and Final Project count for ~20% of the final grade.
Your final grade will be based on a scale of 100 points:
A A- B+ B B- C+ C C- D+ D D- E
100-94 93-89 88-85 84-82 81-79 78-76 75-73 72-70 69-67 66-64 63-60 59-0
Deliverables and grading:
Grading criteria for all deliverables counting toward your final grade:
1. Submitted on time. Any assignment marked as late in Brightspace will have 0 points. Let’s
be specific: Let’s say the submission deadline on Brightspace is 11:59PM, if your
submission is timestamped as 11:59:01, Brightspace will mark it as late. Nothing I can do.
If Brightspace says your submission is late, it is late. No ifs, no buts, no discussion. Please
plan accordingly.
2. Quality. In this course, I will be running the code you write. If I can’t successfully run
your code, I will deduct points.
3. Content. Please read the assignments carefully and make sure you comply with all the
requirements listed in the assignment. Incomplete assignments will have points deducted.
4. You MUST submit ensure that the code repository you are using is publicly accessible. I
have provided instructions on how to create code repositories in GitHub for this class. If
you want to use a different repository, you still must ensure it is accessible and that your
source files are downloadable.
5. In some instances, you will be required to submit a screenshot of the results of your
program. Take pictures if needed and submit the .jpeg files.
6. All grades are individual.
Missed Exams and Assignments: There are no make-up opportunities for missed assignments,
quizzes, and exams, although exceptions are made for religious observance or a medical absence
with a doctor’s note. All class assignments are due on a specific date. Work that is submitted after
the due date will be awarded 0 points. Read more in the University’s Medical Excuse Policy.
